# ‚úÖ Master Agentic AI Engineer ‚Äî Full Development Checklist

This checklist guides the end-to-end development of the Master Agentic AI Engineer program and ensures every component is production-ready, observable, secure, and documented.

Use this file to plan, track, and verify progress. Check items as you complete them.

---

## üìå How to use this checklist
- Work top-down, check off each item when done
- Keep PRs small and scoped to a section when possible
- For each item, ensure Acceptance Criteria (AC) are met before checking
- Link PRs and issues next to the item when completed
