## 🏗️ Core Components

### Core Module (`core/`)
- BaseAgent: Abstract base class for all agent implementations
- Tool: Tool integration and function calling framework
- Executor: Task execution and workflow management
- Config: Configuration management and validation

### Memory Module (`memory/`)
- ShortTermMemory: Working memory for active contexts
- WorkingMemory: Task-oriented memory utilities

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from agent_lib.core import BaseAgent, AgentConfig
from agent_lib.memory import WorkingMemory

class ResearchAgent(BaseAgent):
    async def _execute_task(self, task: str, context: dict) -> dict:
        return {"echo": task, "ctx": context}

agent = ResearchAgent(AgentConfig(name="research_agent"))
```

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
